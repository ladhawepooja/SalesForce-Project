Project Title:
Food Waste Tracking CRM using Salesforce

Problem Statement:
Food wastage is a major issue in the hospitality sector, where restaurants and hotels often generate large amounts of surplus food. Without a proper tracking and coordination system with NGOs or food banks, much of this food goes unutilized. Manual methods like phone calls and spreadsheets make it difficult to track donations, assign suitable NGOs, and ensure timely pickups—resulting in food waste and inefficient coordination.

Solution: Food Waste Tracking CRM using Salesforce

Build a Salesforce CRM system to track and manage surplus food donations efficiently:

Custom Objects: Food Donation, NGO/Food Bank, Pickup Request, Donor.

Automation: Automatically assign NGOs based on location and food type, send alerts/reminders, and reassign if needed.

Dashboards & Reports: Track donations, pickups, and food wastage reduction.

User Access:
Donors (restaurants/hotels) log surplus food.
NGOs accept/decline donations via portal.
Admins monitor and manage the process.

Impact: Reduces food waste, ensures timely donation, and improves coordination between donors and NGOs.
