Project Title
Food Waste Tracking CRM using Salesforce

Problem Statement:
Food wastage is a major issue in the hospitality sector, where restaurants and hotels often generate large amounts of surplus food. Without a proper tracking and coordination system with NGOs or food banks, much of this food goes unutilized. Manual methods like phone calls and spreadsheets make it difficult to track donations, assign suitable NGOs, and ensure timely pickups—resulting in food waste and inefficient coordination.
